<h1>Problem A - Sudoku</h1>
<h3>Time limit: 5 seconds</h3>

<p>
Oh no! Bill just realized that the sudoku puzzle he had spent the last
ten minutes trying to solve essentially was last week's puzzle, only
rotated counterclockwise. How cheap! Couldn't the magazine afford to
make a new one every week? Of course, he had no way of knowing about
this before he started to solve it, as the holes to fill with digits
were other than last week.  Nevertheless, realizing that this week's
puzzle was a simple derivative of last week's certainly took the fun
out of solving the rest of it.

</p><p>

The sudoku board consists of 9×9 cells. These can be grouped
into 3×3 <em>regions</em> of 3×3 cells each. Some of the
cells are filled with a digit 1 through 9 while the rest of them are
left empty.  The aim of the game is to fill each empty cell with a
digit 1...9 so that every row, every column and every region
contains each of the numbers 1...9 exactly once. A proper sudoku
puzzle always has exactly one solution.

</p><p>
Help Bill avoid unpleasant surprises by creating a program that checks
whether an unsolved sudoku puzzle is in fact derived from an earlier
puzzle by simple operations.

</p><p>
The allowed operations are:
</p><ul>
<li> Rotating the entire puzzle clockwise or counterclockwise.
</li><li> Swapping two columns within a 3×9 column segment.
</li><li> Swapping two rows within a 9×3 row segment.
</li><li> Swapping entire row or column segments.  
</li><li> Applying a permutation <em>f</em> of the digits 1...9 to every
cell (i.e. replace <em>x</em> by <em>f(x)</em> in every cell).
</li></ul>

<p>
An operation is considered being performed on the sudoku solution
(rather than on the unsolved puzzle) and always guarantees that if the
board before the transformation was a solution to a sudoku puzzle, it
still is afterwards.

</p><h2>Input</h2> 

<p>
The input starts with the number of test cases 0 &#8804; <em>N</em> &#8804;
50 on a single line.

</p><p>
Then for every test case follow nine lines describing last week's
puzzle solution, from top to bottom.  Each line corresponds to a row
in the puzzle and consists of nine digits (1...9), describing
the contents of the cell from left to right.

</p><p>
Last week's solution is followed by nine lines describing this week's
unsolved puzzle. Here, also, every line corresponds to a puzzle row
and every digit (0...9) describes the contents of a cell. 0
indicates that the cell is empty. The rows are presented ordered from
top to bottom, and within each row, the cells are ordered from left to
right.

</p><p>
After every test case except the last one follows a blank line. Every
unsolved puzzle is guaranteed to be uniquely solvable and last week's
solution is always a proper sudoku solution.

</p><h2>Output</h2>
For every test case, output <tt>Yes</tt> if the sudoku puzzle can be
derived from the given solved puzzle using the allowed operations, or
<tt>No</tt> if this is not possible.
