<H2>Problem G - Gopher that walks and swims</H2><IMG hspace=20 
src="G_files/G.jpg" align=right vspace=20> A gopher lives in the flatlands of 
Northern Saskatchewan and frequently visits his cousins living in the South-East 
part of the same province. When going on a visit the gopher has to cross a lot 
of ditches. 
<P>Saskatchewan has been suffering years of severe drought. Recently, however, 
they experienced a period of unusually heavy rains which resulted in flooding 
all the ditches on the gopher's route. 
<P>The ditches run along straight lines in the West-East or South-North 
direction and each ditch is of a constant width. The gopher still wants to make 
his travels but being not a very good swimmer, he wants to minimize the distance 
that he has to swim across the ditches. With this requirement satisfied, he also 
wants to walk as little as possible on the dry land. Your task is to find the 
length of the gopher's route which minimizes his swimming and then his walking. 
<P>We are given a system of orthogonal coordinates, where the <EM>x</EM> axis is 
directed from West to East and the <EM>y</EM> axis is directed from South to 
North. Given are positive real numbers: <EM>D</EM> and <EM>L</EM>, <EM>L+L</EM> 
&lt; <EM>D</EM>, such that a point (<EM>x</EM>, <EM>y</EM>) is on dry land if 
and only if there exist integers <EM>m</EM> and <EM>n</EM> such that 
<CENTER><EM>m*D+L</EM> &lt;= <EM>x</EM> &lt;= <EM>(m+1)*D-L</EM> and 
<BR><EM>n*D+L</EM> &lt;= <EM>y</EM> &lt;= <EM>(n+1)*D-L</EM>. </CENTER>
<P>Given is the starting point of the gopher (<EM>x<SUB>s</SUB>, 
y<SUB>s</SUB></EM>) and its target point (<EM>x<SUB>t</SUB>, 
y<SUB>t</SUB></EM>). Both these points are on dry land and also 
<CENTER>0 &lt; <EM>x<SUB>s</SUB> &lt;= x<SUB>t</SUB></EM>, <BR><EM>y<SUB>s</SUB> 
&gt;= y<SUB>t</SUB></EM> &gt; 0, <BR><EM>x<SUB>t</SUB>-x<SUB>s</SUB></EM> &lt;= 
<EM>y<SUB>s</SUB>-y<SUB>t</SUB></EM>. </CENTER>It is also known that the gopher 
on his way to the target point will not have to swim through more than 300 
ditches. 
<P>Each line of input contains six numbers: <EM>D</EM>, <EM>L</EM>, 
<EM>x<SUB>s</SUB>, y<SUB>s</SUB></EM>, <EM>x<SUB>t</SUB>, y<SUB>t</SUB></EM>. 
For each line of input, output one line with the needed information in the 
format shown in the sample output. The last line of input has the value of 
<EM>D</EM> equal to zero and this line should not be processed.
