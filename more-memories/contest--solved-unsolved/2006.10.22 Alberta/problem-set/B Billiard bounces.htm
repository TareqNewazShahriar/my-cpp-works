<H2>Problem B: Billiard bounces </H2><IMG 
src="Problem B Billiard bounces_files/B.jpg" align=center> 
<P>
<P>On a billiard table with a horizontal side <B>a</B> inches long and a 
vertical side <B>b</B> inches long, a ball is launched from the middle of the 
table with initial velocity <B>v</B> inches per second and launching angle 
<B>A</B> between 0 and 90 degrees measured counter-clockwise from the 
horizontal. 
<P>Assume that collisions with a side are elastic (no energy loss), and thus the 
absolute value of a velocity component of the ball parallel to each side remains 
unchanged after the bounce. However, due to friction the ball decelerates at a 
constant rate and comes to a full stop after <B>s</B>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0 seconds. 
Assume the ball has a radius of zero. Remember that, unlike pool tables, 
billiard tables have no pockets. 
<P>How many times will the ball touch the vertical walls and how many times will 
the ball touch the horizontal walls? If the ball touches a corner it means that 
it touched both a horizontal and a vertical wall. 
<P>Input consists of a sequence of lines, each containing five nonnegative 
integers separated by whitespace. The five numbers are: 
<B>a</B>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0, <B>b</B>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0, <B>v</B>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0, 
0&nbsp;&#8804;&nbsp;<B>A</B>&nbsp;&#8804;&nbsp;90, and <B>s</B>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0, 
respectively. 
<P>Input is terminated by a line containing five zeroes. 
<P>For each input line except the last, output a line containing two integer 
numbers separated by a single space. The first number says how many times the 
ball touched vertical walls and the second number says how many times the ball 
touched horizontal walls.
