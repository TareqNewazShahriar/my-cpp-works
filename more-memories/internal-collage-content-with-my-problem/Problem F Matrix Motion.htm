## Matrix Motion

A Matrix is an arrangement of values in rows and columns. It has a lot of distinct properties. Now you will do some motion with this matrix.

You will be given a M x N matrix. You have to reform this matrix so that the row values become column values in the new matrix.

### Input

The first line of the input contains the number of test cases, n<=100. In each case the value of X and Y will be given in one line where X is the number of rows and Y is the number of columns. Then a matrix of X rows and Y columns will be given. Assume that X,Y<100. 

### Output 

Output the string “Case n :” where n is the case number in one line. Then print the complement matrix from the next line. See sample input/output below.

### Sample Input
```
3

3 3

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 9

5 5

1 1 1 1 1

0 0 0 0 0

1 0 1 0 1

0 0 0 0 0

1 1 1 1 1

2 2

```

### Sample Output
```
Case 1 :

1 4 7

2 5 8

3 6 9

Case 2 :

1 0 1 0 1

1 0 0 0 1

1 0 1 0 1

1 0 0 0 1

1 0 1 0 1

Case 3 :
