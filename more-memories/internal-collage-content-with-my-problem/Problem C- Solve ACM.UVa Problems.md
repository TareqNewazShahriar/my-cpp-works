## Problem B
**Solve ACM.UVa Problems**
Time limit: 5 Seconds  

Sorting and searching is an important algorithm in programming. Therefore, you need to determine the appropriate algorithm in speed and memory point of view.

Now you are given ‘**n**’ number of ACM.UVa problems with their serial number and name. Sort them in ascending order by problems serial number and find a problem.

**Input specification**

First number **n** indicates how many problems number with name has in this input where

**n**≤ 5000 (But ACM.UVa has 1782 problems till 18 Jan 2006. So there may have duplicate problems). Next **n** lines followed, the problems number-name is given. Then a blank line and then given a problem name to search. The problem numbers is ≤10999 and the name is ≤75 characters.

**Output specification**

First display in a line “Task **t:**”, a space; then display “**Problem\_number** **Problem\_Name** found at position **p**”. Where **t** is replaced by consecutive task number starts from **1**. **Problem\_number** and **Problem\_Name** is replaced by the searched problem’s number and name. Finally, **p** is replaced by the searched problem’s sorted position. Each problem number should be right aligned in a field of 6 characters after the task number and the colon.
